1;BUT then I listened to it and I love all the songs on it.
2;The CSN (and sometimes Y) songs on this album are great to listen to, especially if you are very familiar with the originals.
3;I cannot listen to enough of Josh Groban's work -- he's truly a master at his craft.
4;It is feel good music.
5;Wonderful worship cd that you can listen to in the car and worship the Lord all the way to work.
6;With Easy Rider the film was made and relevant music added and what a great result!
7;It's good eats, even with silly love songs, and Linda really is The Cook Of The House...Indulge yourself!
8;Song for song this CD is great.
9;He is a genius and his music thrills me.
10;This song really puts you in a good, hopeful mood.
11;Great job of getting this put to digital...If you are a Warren Zevon fan, you will probably already have this in your collection.
12;This is a great album to listen to at work (if you're lucky enough to be able to).
13;There are a bunch of great songs on this album!
14;I'm listening to it on Meyer Studio monitors and it sounds great, what a performer that JB was, I love how he guides the band along as they're recording the song, "take me to the bridge"...When I want to get inspired to play some funk horn parts in the studio I listen to these tracks, this is the sound that defined soul and funk...Good music to all
15;Listening to The Brothers perform Will The Circle Be Unbroken still sends shivers down my spine.
17;Great music from the Ohio Players!
16;The synth work on the song is great.
19;Great music from a great singer/songwriter
18;This is a very talented band and definitely worth a listen to for anyone who is in to this kind of music
21;It's so good you'll listen to it all the time !
20;"I Never" and "Imagination" are really good tracks....excellent car music.
23;I can listen to him over and over, Song selection was great.
22;Reality Show had its highlights and skip-worthy songs, but listening to the album entirely will conclude that Jazmine Sullivan is back and strong as ever.
25;Joey and Rory's music is refreshingly real,.
24;Great to listen and drive my car to.
27;still love listening to it.
26;This CD is a great compilation of Zevon's work.
29;This are not just romantic songs, but there are also lots of fun and swinging.
28;Good cd for relaxing or just listening.
31;It is a good listen.
30;The Wall Live in Berlin has a few great spots as well so it is a must have for a Pink Floyd fan...It is the show that Waters puts on that makes it work so well.
34;A great selection of Stevie Ray Vaughan's music.
35;listening to this cd and really listening to the lyrics and his voice and i can hear how good he still is.
32;love the 2cd format - great listen
33;I listen to Punk Rock and Ska, but this album is right up there, in my opinion some of the best music ever made.
38;I listen to this while I work and it keeps me both relaxed AND focused which is a tough thing for me.
39;This song is just all around great.
36;This is all great music!
37;As I've said earlier on, it's not Blackout heavy, yet it contains amazing guitar work and truly wonderful sounding songs...Pick it up and enjoy it for what it is, great music with a boatload of feel!
42;The great drive this album put out when you hear it is great.
43;Every song has something about it to make you listen over and over.
40;All in all, it's just fun, exciting music that gives you a warm, cushy feeling inside every time you listen to it.
41;All in all, it's just fun, exciting music that gives you a warm, cushy feeling inside every time you listen to it.
46;A couple of nights ago I took a two hours car trip on my own and I gave this album another chance, ohhh, what a surprise...During the trip I listened to the whole album from start to finish, it was another album, the music, the musical motifs, the lyrics, the story, it's background, what a wonderful adventure this album is.
47;I love Christmas, I love Christmas music,  I love Martina McBride and I absolutley love this album!
44;This album is just crammed with great music.
45;It has some great original Christmas songs that you'll want to listen to year after year!
51;great music to mellow out with, or to listen sofly in the background while having dinner.
50;The music is paced perfectly by the conductor.
49;I always love the soundtrack from this movie, and it's a joy to listen to.the music and just relax.
48;great music with great service
55;It has all of the great hits and I discovered some of the lesser known songs listening to this too.
54;Good music to listen too.
53;An essential CD for what ever your mood.
52;this Elvis cd  is better the the original album it sounds sharper and has more songs and the 2nd cd is great
59;Though the people he performs with are great, of course...I suggest it and especially for easy jazz listening or for background at a party or dinner... it's really good.
58;His music is nice to listen too.
57;The song selection is great.
56;Battleships is my very fav
63;Listen there's at least something for every rock fan here and you'll discover some great music by bands you've probably never heard of before, for example: For Love not Lisa's Slip Slide Melting, you have got to hear it.
62;The music is complex without being overindulgent.
61;But anyway, his voice doesn't get annoying enough to make me not want to listen to this CD, and it definitely should not divert you away...Stromblad and Gelotte, as well as bassist Peter Iwers, are amazing on this CD, as usual.
60;ACOS is really a representation of the kind of music DT set out to do from the very beginning: Progressive themes with complex time signatures mixed with philosophically challenging lyrics and a 'metal' edge.
68;It is kind of a mood album, something that can be put on in the background, or something that you can take time out to listen to.
69;Because music is best understood while being listened to.
70;The first (2) releases were both excellent pieces of work, but upon listening to "Afterglow" the music is more coheisive and their is a better blending of the talents within the band.
71;It's just  great music, period.
64;In the mood is a great tune with an awesome driving tom-fill solo by collins along with great high-hat work.
65;I found a real good price from a third party dealer and when I opened it I was so happy.
66;But all the extras on here are a great listen for a real fan.
67;this is a great cd I love the song it's from 1976 a year of great music and a great band
76;This has been one of my favorite Harrison albums
77;Makes you appreciate his talent and humor to listen to these again.
78;Then get Negotiations and Love Songs for a good sample of his work before Graceland, and get The Best of Simon and Garfunkel for his extraordinary work with Art Garfunkel, the collaboration he is most famous for.
79;The music supports her storytelling, bursting with sensual richness.
72;And faster blade is the most underrated song on this album.
73;CD plays well and the music is good.
74;The songs are great 1970-80s music.
75;This is one of the best CD's I have ever listened to!
85;"Summer, Highland Falls" and "I've Loved These Days" are so emotional and romantic.
84;I listened again and again and... I love this album with a fiery passion.
87;This is a very good album with some of the O'Jays's great songs.
86;Great music by a genius
81;Bought this cd and constantly play it in my car.
80;She defines what an "Artist" is...she is art, the very expression of life.
83;Every song is either good or great.
82;Like good music when I walk or exercise.
93;I put this music on in the evenings and honestly, it relaxes me!!
92;Really gets you in the Christmas mood.
95;Great album and I continue to listen over and over again
94;I listen to it anytime I'm in the mood to be impressed by music.
89;Listen Feist is for me a great sensation.
88;It's because this music is still so vibrant, vulnerable and magical.
91;Now this is real music!
90;I love the Celtic Thunder music.
102;I choose this CD because it's a great one, also I love gospel music.
103;But I still like the music and I am a real fan of Freddie Mercury.
100;Just listen to Ricks heyday albums, Journey to the Center of the Earth and King Arthur-- perfectly good albums that merge orchestras, choirs, and progressive rock, but theres not really any experimental music happening.
101;for me , good music
98;Practically every song on this is good and enjoyable to listen to.
99;I loved listening this CD.
96;"Sessions" could be defined as  multidimentional,  in that it is the perfect album for that night drive in  your car, dinner music for the hippest of coktail parties, downbeat club  dancing,...even serves as the quintessential sensual mix for that perfect,  romantic evening where you turn down the lights, fire up a few candles  and...well, use your imagination here.
97;I love their music, and this album is one that I listen to often.
110;Once I listened to the entire album I absolutely loved it!
111;This is another great album by NOFX with diversity and a bunch of great songs.
108;easy-listening songs to listen and definitely my fav.
109;The music is revitalized and transcendent.
106;This album is great and every song is good with my favorite being F.I.N.E !
107;Now I enjoy listening good songs.
104;Grew up listening to this great musician and entertainer, as my parents played his music all the time.
105;He isn't that good but it fits the music really well.
119;Great music then and great music now.
118;To wrap it up in a nutshell: I believe in great progressive music again, because of this CD.
117;My three kids also love listening to it in the car, especially #2.
116;Each song is unique in its music and lyrics.
115;Great concept, having these albums together.
114;Sounds great, great to listen while working out, driving!
113;Every song is great and for a different mood.
112;Always look forward to relaxing doing my hobbies and listening to this kind of music.
127;That's why I listen to them, because the lryics are so sick but hilarious.
126;Overall the music is breathtaking and shesmovedon can give me shivers sometimes when i listen to the solo by myself.
125;It is on the CD titled "Moondance" which also has some other great songs like Caravan, Into The Mystic, and Glad Tidings...I put this CD in and I just feel good.
124;well as music goes here it is go get it , its a great album for driving, relaxing, and is inspirational, an 80s band years ahead of their time and one i doubt will be out of your c.d drive for a while.
123;Great songs that Gene shines on are "Thou Shalt  Not", and "Spit".
122;And the music is so good I don't care if they are murdering, satanic psychos or whatever else.
121;I listened to it, loved it and I still do.
120;Here, we have a brilliant assemblage of '60s tunes that will transport any Baby Boomer back to as close as one can get to the good old days...I particularly love this CD because they've revived some great songs that would have been otherwise forgotten for me.
137;I'm actually AMAZED at how EXCEPTIONAL the music is!
136;great music at a great price.
139;Each girl sang A song and where great and the one who played the violin was very good all of them made it feel we were there.
138;This performer and his music are still great.
141;So in the end...what you have is a well thought out, perfectly executed homage to a period of Deep Purple's legacy, by the very man who helped create that legacy.
140;This album is more for the car when you just want to sing along and have fun.
143;I listened to it, loved it and I still do.
142;Their.first album-BLASPHEMY MADE FLESH-had two great songs("Open Face.Surgery" and "Defenestration")but all the songs on NSV have a.killer intensity that is awe-inspiring.
129;This a very nice CD and I have in my car.
128;He was the one, who.revolutionized the music.
131;Another great edition to my music library!
130;One of my all-time favorite songs, it's both catchy and odd at the same time...The music for Move On was inspired by playing 'All the Young Dudes' backwards
133;This CD is one great listen.
132;I'm a fan of good music
135;It is great country music.
134;I found that it's a great "road" album - stuff I love to listen to while I'm out driving.
152;For me, this is relaxing yet invigorating.
153;Well, over time I have listened to this album again & again as Maxwell's beautiful voice, stellar lyrics & excellent production collided in my ears and finally, I GOT IT and the music spoke to me!
154;For whatever reason, t his CD has got the bad rap over the years, with many claiming it's one of Slayer's worst...After NOT hearing this for a long, long time, I went back to it, and I have no idea why I ever stopped listening to it, or why a lot of Slayer fans don't like it...I'm not going to get into details here, but all I can say is to give it a second listen, and another chance...It's great.
155;Smooth Tyrone Davis sample...You Don't Understand - 10/10 *really smooth, relaxing song
156;It's a good song to listen to when  you are down...  8.
157;But it is great music.
158;Was so beautiful I didn't even feel weird listening to Christmas music in May
159;It evokes sense of spiritual peace with nature and is quite relaxing to listen to...The beauty of this album is that, even with the separate standout songs, it flows together as one complete journey with each song feeding seamlessly into the next.
144;You'll agree with me when you listen to it!
145;Was so beautiful I didn't even feel weird listening to Christmas music in May
146;I listened with him and agree it's good stuff.
147;This album is a must have if your really into Korn and the raw emotion and thought they put into their trend setting music.
148;I am almost finished listening to this album for the first time, and it is an incredible masterpiece of music.
149;It's very romantic music and creates great mood for lovin'.
150;They listen, sing and dance to it, so it must be really good.
151;This doesn't disappoint, and it's one I listen to over and over.
171;Ladies and gentlemen:  You will listen to music from the world's most dynamic stage entertainer.
170;Play it in your car and it will make you feel like a teen again...I always loved "Snakeskin cowboys" a rocker that is very catchy and fast paced..."Hey Baby" is a cover of  a classic blues tune and this faster paced version works well..."Just what the Doctor Ordered" is the last great song off the album...The other songs are also good.
169;The lyrics are great and the music is put together well.
168;I love to listen to his music, especially Rhapsody in Blue.
175;This is the album that define their music style.
174;Great listen with lots of soundstage.
173;Danielle is truly gonna be one of the biggest names in country music.
172;the more I listen to this band the more I love their music & style.
163;But "Jester Race/Black-Ash Inheritance" isn't just a great listen, it's also very influential.
162;I guarantee, like any great funk music, it will always put you in a good mood.
161;But for the casually interested, Capitol has put out a very good overview of Minnie Riperton's music.
160;Great driving and listening music
167;Awesome music and a great listen.
166;Its a great CD, my kind of music.
165;Just an all around great song on a great album.
164;Kiss the Flame is the most romantic song, ever.
186;I had heard one song from their Southtown album and I loved it, so when I was at the music store, I decided to get this one.
187;Its good music all around!
184;If only for Meisner's incredible self-induced harmonic at the very end of "Take it to the Limit" this is a real gem.
185;All of these songs are great.
190;I felt naughty in a good way while listening to it but didn't fully appreciate the album at the time despite knowing it was good.
191;This is good listening music.
188;A great CD worth getting for any music fan, not just their fans!
189;Great band and the CD is perfect for putting in your car on shuffle and hitting the road...
178;He's my new favorite and this CD is a good way to get introduced to his music

177;Every song on the CD is great.
182;I just love listening to Linda sing - what a voice!
183;When I listen to this CD I can hear the love and feel her affection towards her roots.

181;This is just a plain, great work of music.
205;I listen to this alot in my car and I enjoy it.
204;Babs puts her comedic skills to work here and makes this one of the most charming songs on the album.
207;"Man On A Wire" is another great song.
206;Great Music + Great Price = Great Deal.
201;It Brought Booty Back, and so much more: her definitive freshwoman effort and has been well played wherever I can promote her new album to my friends
200;It seems that however many times you listen to the songs of Sondheim (music as well as lyrics) you can discover something new.
203;The music is fast, ultra-agressive, technically advanced "power metal."
202;I love to listen to his music, especially Rhapsody in Blue.
197;Being a longtime musician and student of the arts myself,I listen to this great work often.
196;This music is just good for the ears.
199;It's the anti-pop music I love to listen to.
198;Everytime you listen to this CD you'll find  yourself within the music, and falling in love again.
193;all the music are her hits so the whole CD is great + I love listening to Annie Lennox she got a great voice
192;One listen and you'll understand why.
195;Then one of the most  upbeat songs I have ever heard and one that always puts me in a great mood,  "Shiny Happy People."
194;Okay so the music is challanging.
220;Ranks right up there with the greats of music.
221;This album has two very good songs on it.

214;I have listened to and been around some extremely talented musicians.
215;The music videos for Get Your Gunn and Dope Hat are so great.
208;Love his music great cd
209;They got more work to do but, for their debut album and to put it together in the amount of time they had,  great music.
210;Very good music and I will be buying her other CDs soon when i have time to listen.
211;there are some great songs all through this album.
239;Still puts out great music.
238;Once you listen to this wonderful album and the great selection of songs you will want to listen again and again.
237;great music it's Tim McGraw
236;Amazon has a great music selection and great prices.
235;The CD is good country music to the core.
234;Also I love the fact that KISS has different styles of music.
233;Still these are worth a listen.
232;Like many great live albums in the pantheon of rock music they were able to find their groove early on and it does not stop until the very end of the album.

230;It's great dance music, and the beats are interesting to listen to.

224;I love to put this CD on and listen to from beginning to end.
254;i love the 80's music.
255;Great lp for anyone who loves the blues and rock from one of the great british rock blues guitarists from the late 60's, 70's and still probably playing today with his band ten years After, not sure how many surviving original members are left, Robert, Las Vegas, Nevada ps: Once you start listening to this music you will want to play it over and over!
252;all their music is awesome--as usual !!!
253;After HOG, the album has some great songs.

251;But wether you're copy has videos or not, it's still a great album to listen to and enjoy.
248;It is a very fun song that puts me in a good mood.
249;I listen to it again and again, but "that's me."
246;Great voice, great music, great all around.
247;Just listen to the songs and the way they're played.
244;And speaking of the Stones, Otis' version of (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction is a surprisingly good reading of the just rock classic, especially considering it's a fine example of record company prostitution - the Rolling Stones had hit big with it a few months prior to this album's release.
245;You can listen to the lyrics as well as get going with great music.
242;I love this album, though it's not quite as explicit as The Sickness, it's still a great listen.
243;Very good music from the 60's.
240;I chose this rating because I have always loved Johnny Paycheck's music and the song "Take This Job" is one of my favorites.
241;After about the third listen through, I began to believe this CD is Mark's essence, what he has really wanted to achieve all along.
275;What they really had in common was great drummers.
274;In fact, the production is so good that it really adds to the intensity and heaviness of the music more so than any previous Exodus CD in my opinion.
273;You will not be disappointed...Summary - great music, played with zest by five guys who worked together beautifully.
272;I have every Jaheim album, He's constantly putting out great work.
279;Just listen to the songs and the way they're played.
278;Good CD and good music.
277;I first listened to the digital copy of the album right away before I received the CD and noticed it wasn't censored.
276;I was beginning to get disappointed with the NOW series to the point that I couldn't keep listening to them in my car but this is a good release and it has restored my love for this series.
283;Just listen to the opening orchestral flourish!
282;A great cd and a lot of great songs and music as well.
281;I loved listening to the Carpenters when I was really young.
280;I'm a longtime fan of all her music.
287;It was in great shape and I love the music, play it all the time.
286;By the time I'd listened to it all the way through, I was determined to own it...Because this album is seriously great.
285;," "Party Up," and other songs...you  would have to listen to the lyrics closely.
284;The sound is good, the price is reasonable and the music is great...If you're not familiar with Ben E. King this CD would be a good introduction.
258;I am putting together a show for a non-profit and this CD will work great as background music.
259;So enjoy listening to this CD...David Garrett is, to put it mildly, a genius.
256;Amazon has a Great music store!!
257;Despite the egotistical lyrics, this is a great song to work out to.

263;Her voice is crisp and clear and is pleasant to listen to and will put you in the Christmas mood.
260;One friend challenged me to simply listen to the music.
261;I love listening to Janelle on those cloudy days~ Her music is different, but very attractive.
266;I will never tire of music that is this passionate, intense and expressive.
267;There are times when I listen to that song 3 times back to back!
264;This is great, just like all of Joey and Rory'store music
265;There is not a bad song on this cd and it is a good and pleasant listening mix of all of his music.
270;Yet both can also be categorized as romantic songs.
271;This is still a fun CD to listen to years after the music faded.
268;good music if you are into him
269;Benefit is one of those albums, I can continually listen to.
305;This is a great album.

311;Good music from Trace Adkins.
310;Great entry album for those who have not listened to them before.

312;He has a great voice and this CD has a good mix of slower, relaxed songs as well as more up-tempo songs to balance it well.
315;Vangelis is always a great musician and his songs are always pleasant to listen.
314;I love the balance of metal and nostalgic/period music in this album.
317;But all of the music is good.
316;I'm enjoying listening to it.
319;A mesmerizing song to listen to.
318;The Colour of Spring was certainly the peak of his "traditional" career, but with this album, it is like if he had reinvented the music.
288;i listen to this cd all the time, came in good condition and good shape.
289;Ray Davies, with this record, made me realize that I do love a good story put to music.
290;They are unique and this cd is just plain fun to listen too!
291;It is really incredible to listen to the album.
292;I have made some adjustment after listening and still feel you need a mature young Christian to ensure they know the words/message are the base and the music is secondary.
293;This entire album is worth a listen.
294;We've listened to it together and both of us love the music, the songs, and the incredible voices of the Celtic Women!
295;This song will make you listen twice just to prove that its actually real.
296;I've loved Leonard Cohen's music since the 60's.
297;I have always loved Dan Fogelberg's music and have all of his albums on vinyl.
298;I've been listening to this album for over 40 Christmases, and it still makes me feel great every time I play it.
299;That is the beauty of art and music.
300;i have to admit that "i cant make music" is one of the finer songs on this album.
301;It is a very fun song that puts me in a good mood.
302;I loved listening to this CD.
303;The music accentuates Palumbo and his voice as well as the mood throughout.
343;Any music by Tony Bennett is great!
342;But all is forgiven once you listen to the material.
341;The music is muscular and very well produced.
340;this band is one of the few that defines great music to rock out or to relax and enjoy .
339;Overall this was a good CD, the music was great.
338;The music on this Ray Price CD was great.
337;Some really great music on this album.

552;It's beautiful, I can listen to it all day.
553;This is the best music you can ever listen to.
567;The vinyl made me hear the project in sections so i am able to digest the music.

589;I am not a country music fan but this is a pleasant album
590;Listen and buy this if you want to have a blast and enjoy what you're listening to, the introduction is great and songs like Harlem world can't fail, while having been tossed around with songs like sweet sugar oie, and brought back down to earth with songs like raw ride, this album is something to behold!
591;Because this music is so incredible (and expensive)  I transferred them to three double jewel cases.
593;The Springsteen and Dylan songs work the best, putting a new twist on some good songs.
592;They have all the most popular songs on them, and you get them at a great price.

680;When you aren't listening to it, you'll be humming it.
679;Although all of Dylan's work is considered great, this album is preceded by Dylan's famous three folk statements, and followed by album after album of rock and country Dylan with a band...Another Side of Bob Dylan is one of Dylan's most important records made, in his very prime, and showing the greatness of his musical "talent" while only needing the safeguard of his guitar and harmonica.
678;But curious as I'm, I started to listen to some music from her.
677;The 7th "Treat me well" is a beautiful ballad, romantic, tender, that kind of music we don't listen anymore, without being phony.

675;This is worth a listen.
674;Great country music as it ought to be.
673;What a great selection of music!
672;This is one of the roots of music.
702;Into the Pit is done so well I had to pull my car over on the freeway and I listened with my mouth wide open.
703;It is essential listening for anyone who values great improvisational music.

1345;I have always been a fan of Madonna
1405;Something/Anything puts you in a good mood and then, if you are so inclined, allows you to delve into its protean styles.

1407;All of their music is worth listening to over and over.
1406;Great music to listen while you are working out.

1400;I find her music so comforting to listen to after a long day at work.
1403;At Last is almost guaranteed enormous chart success, but one gets the feeling upon listening to it that Cyndi could care less how popular her music is.

1302;This cd is great for any mood U are in, if blue than he will join U there with his music
1301;I feel that if James Honeyman Scoot played keyboards on Space Invader (like he did on other tracks), it would've set a better mood for the song, but overall, it's still a pretty good instrumental, and I love that snaeaky bass solo in the beginning from Pete.
1300;well, hell yeah the music is good!
1290;They wrote and played great songs, including love songs and lyrics with real feelings, and had a great sense of melody, composition, harmony, and all those other qualities that make for great music.

1282;Another Motown favorite - this is how great songs were made

1337;love the  songs on it.it is  a  really great  cd.

1331;Years ago I worked in radio for a year and we were able to bring albums home from the station to borrow overnight if we wanted to listen to something.

1332;good cd, enjoy listening to it
1335;This is really a great album to listen to on a sunny day, driving around.
1334;What a great album and plenty of tracks too...This is their most satisfying album to listen to and much more varied in sound than "Superunkown" as good as that album is, this takes the cake...Very Cool, they've called it quits now and they knew when to go, and are a great band, unlike Pearl Jam who just don't know when to stop and since 1999 have put out dissapointmenting material.
1320;But we hold to the belief that good music is good music, and you can never have enough.
1321;Great album, all good songs
1322;The thing with Miranda is she's soooo good she could record a CD of her just belching and it would be GREAT!

1316;This one contains a nice sampling of their music, just enough to listen to on a quiet drive home from work.
1317;His music is on the feel good, easy to listen to style.
1318;Love listening to his music!
1319;But this is one of Albert's great songs, one that made his name.
1494;All 10 songs feature great song-craft, innimitable style and mood, and something that should've never been absent from trip-hop or 90's music in general - joy.
1495;And the music's as good as Ronstadt's voice.
1492;This CD is a must have for all fans of the 70's music.
1493;My kids are preteens and they are loving these sons even my toddler can listen to this music.

1479;One can just 'Rock Out' with Tina listening to the songs!
1478;One listen to the album, and you'll realize why.
1477;"Feel For You" is a great song.
1476;They've made incredible music all this time and I feel I've gotten more from them than I've given.
1475;When you're completely [upset], this, much like Break Stuff, can be great to listen to, It'll really cheer you up.
